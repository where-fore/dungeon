Here is the original game. I was involved in a Treehouse online Python course, and as a part of that course we were tasked to make a little game similar to this. I really enjoyed the project, and added my own flairs to the game. I am quite happy with it, and proud of how it turned out.

If you have Python 3 already installed on your computer, feel free to double click the Dungeon.py file.

Otherwise, feel free to head over to an online host of the Python code at : https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_python_interpreter

    Open up the Dungeon.py file in your notepad editor, and just copy and paste all the code into the site.
    
        Ideally you should see some instructions infront of you that I left at the bottom of the file.
        
        Otherwise, just press run at the top of the site and a console should open at the bottom of the site, with the game ready!


        
Thanks for playing! I hope you enjoy.
