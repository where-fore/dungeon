Dungeon Game
Unity

Originally a python console game developed as part of a python course, and polished as a personal project. 
Now being created in Unity, using a 2D, top down perspective and pixel art, tile-based graphics



TO DO
------
current:






Code Cleanup
---------------------------------

Comment all code. :D

--Fix float comparing: Right now I compare floats using > and <. This will occassionally lead to rounding errors and allow eg. players to walk through walls. Not sure best fix, but comparing the difference of the floats to 0.9 works alright.

--Consolodate West/East Movement bounds into one set of variables on game manager or something

--Reference other scripts more robustly, as per bookmarked youtube video

--Create master class/namespace that all my scripts inherit from, with things like the movement bounds, gameTurnManager, etc

--Make WaitCommands.cs work as intended

--For game messages: instead of making it a string field and then editing that field, instead have a list of strings to display, and display them in first-in-first-out method -> that way I can tell the ladder to remove the "escape now" dialogue when the player leaves the ladder, without completly clearing the top message text(in case there is another important message)
----have each message have a queue to leave the list

--AudioControl.cs -> transition time default that is used in most transitions (5.5f seconds), set that to a variable for the whole script instead of 5.5f in each transition method.

--Not code related, but make the sprites 64x64 or something. 50x50 is dumb lol
---------------------------------


Bugs
-----
Obs:
    bug
Int:
    intended
    
Obs:
    player can occasionally walk through walls -> i believe it has to do with the transform rounding, and comparing those values to the limits i hardcoded in the movement scripts
Int:
    player cannot ever move through walls.

Notes
------

September 18, 2018 9:44am -> copied rigidbody2d from player and added to monster, to allow for OnTriggerStay2D functionality(ladder usability) -> everything seems normal and bugfree, but be careful

50px x 50px per Unity unit Assets - imported as 1000x1000.png sprites. -> Make sure to set Unity units per pixel to 1000 instead of the default 100.

November 5, 2018 11:50am -> Grace takes about 1.5 seconds to read each slide.
