Issues
-------

Corners don't always reveal
    > I think this is a symptom of the major location problem - everything should be rounded to nearest int, and use rigidbodies/triggers properly
    
Mashing space to skip the opening can lead you to wait on your first turn

You can still press enter to interact with objects during the delay between you being eaten and the game ending



Features
---------

Something to restart game, reset map - a main menu (with audio sliders too)

Some indication that enter is to interact

More interesting text/ui - maybe borrow from number guesser ui







also my note to try to fix the wonky placement detection
(where transform.position.x should = 3, but it is slightly rounded so calculations like
        [is (monster.transform.position.x == player.transform.position.x)]
        do not function properly
-

have every object have a private int xCoord = 0 {get, return xCoord}
                         private int yCoord = 0 {get, return yCoord}
and use these to compare to each other
    private void Update()
    {
        transform.position = new Vector2(xCoord, yCoord);
    }
    
    


also - considering making gameplay/teaser/release trailers (or other advertisements) for all the games, just for practice
